Objective:

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

• Create a new Demo page as a route inside the app/ folder.
• Update the Expo Router type definitions in .expo/types/router.d.ts so TypeScript recognizes the new route.
• Use useRouter() inside app/(tabs)/index.tsx to navigate to the Demo page.

Instructions:

1. Create the Demo Page under app/
        • Open your project and locate the app/ folder.
        • Create a new file named app/demo.tsx.


2. Modify the Route Types in .expo/types/router.d.ts
        • Open the .expo/types/ folder.
        • Open router.d.ts.
        • Locate the section where valid routes/paths are defined (often a union type of allowed strings).
        • Add the Demo route path: "/demo".

• Goal: TypeScript should accept navigation calls like router.push("/demo") without route/type errors.

• Note: This file is often auto-generated, but for this assignment you must update it manually to practice typed routing.


3. Use useRouter() in (tabs)/index.tsx to Navigate
        • Open app/(tabs)/index.tsx.
        • Import useRouter() from expo-router.
        • Add a button/link/tap target on the Tabs index screen that navigates to the Demo page using router.push("/demo").

• Expected behavior: When the user selects your navigation control on the tabs index page, the app navigates to the Demo page.


4. Run and Test
        • Start the app with npx expo start.
        • Verify the following:
        • The (tabs) index screen loads correctly.
        • Your navigation control works.
        • The app navigates to /demo.
        • The Demo page displays plain HTML tags only.
        • No TypeScript route errors appear after editing router.d.ts.


• Deliverables
        • app/demo.tsx (your Demo page)
        • Updated .expo/types/router.d.ts (showing "/demo" added)
        • Updated app/(tabs)/index.tsx (showing useRouter() navigation to "/demo")
