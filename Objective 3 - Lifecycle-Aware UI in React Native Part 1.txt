Objective:

• Build a simple React Native app that:
    • Uses AppState Links to an external site. to pause and resume tasks when the app goes to the background or returns to the foreground.
    • Persists volatile UI state when the app is backgrounded or quit, so the user experience is not lost.

Instructions:

• Create a new React Native project or use existing one
• Set up a simple UI with:
        • A text input or counter component to represent volatile state.
        • A button to simulate a network request (can use fetch to a public API or mock URL).
• Use the AppState API to detect when the app goes to the background or foreground:
       • Pause any ongoing tasks when backgrounded.
        • Resume tasks when the app becomes active again.
