Objective:

Build a simple React Native app that:

• Persists volatile UI state when the app is backgrounded or quit, so the user experience is not lost.

• Centralizes error handling and displays user-friendly notifications (toast or snackbar) when errors occur.

• Implements retry strategies for failed network requests.
    
• Introduces lightweight state management (React Context or Redux Toolkit) for app-wide state.

Instructions:

1. Persist the UI state using AsyncStorage so that the state is restored when the app restarts.
    
2. Implement centralized error handling:
        • Wrap components with an error boundary for render errors.
        • Use try/catch for async operations.
        • Show toast or snackbar notifications for errors.
    
3. Add retry logic for failed network requests (e.g., retry up to 3 times with a delay).
   
4. Test your app:
        • Simulate network errors and confirm retry and error notifications work.
